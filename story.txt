Ali was a slob. He woke up at at dawn and demolished the remains of a KFC bucket he ordered for lunch the day before. As usual, he left his house at 5AM for a 5k run, he was fast. Very fast. For what you dont know is..Ali was not human, not anymore. Not since he was bittin by a radioactive chicken as a child.

Ali didn't knew that, but he was also a cannibal! He knew he was different, but by the time he discovered why, he already was addicted to KFC! But he always avoided MC, fearing that the radioactive hamburgers from MC could make him even worst!

Then there was a day, Ali was very hungury. He was alone on the street where the only place he could get some food was MC. He knew that he should not eat that, but he could not control his emotion. So he went into the MC directly and ordered a hamburger. He started eating...

Immediately, it set in. He began to transform. Like a pokemon, he shape shifted and morphed into a giant radioactive chicken. However, not all was lost, as he actually was not so much monster, but more hero. Soon he would be called Chickenman and overtook Spidermans reign as the cities savior.

Soon, tales of the featherd hero spread across the globe. Ali, once a slob, was now a towering symbol of justice. His next step was an obvious one, MERCH. And that is how Ali surpassed Jeff Bezos as the worlds richest man.
